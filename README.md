# Nand to General Purpose Computer

In this project, I will build the whole computer from scratch using just NAND gates. I will start from the NAND gate and build other gates from it first then will design ALU, CPU, and other components, and then will combine them. After this, I will make the whole software suite so that we could interact with this hardware, like I have to design Operating System, compiler, assembler, and so on.

## Installation

As this project will require simulators for Hardware, CPU etc to test our code. It could be found on [From Nand to Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software).

To run `.hdl` files :

- `Install java, check with java -version`
- ` cd nand2tetris/tools`
- `chmod u+x ~/Downloads/nand2tetris/tools/*.sh`
- ` ./HardwareSimulator.sh`
- `Choose the required chip in simulator`
- `Or choose it's test file`
- `Simulate it and test`

The whole process is shown below in video for easy understanding.
